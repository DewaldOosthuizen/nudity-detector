# Nudity Detector

## Overview

The **Nudity Detector** script is a tool for identifying nudity in images and videos. It uses AI-based models to classify files and organizes detected content into a dedicated folder, generating a comprehensive report afterward.

Two versions of the script are available:

- **Nudenet**: Uses the `nudenet` library for nudity detection.
  - Basic
  - Not always accurate
  - Process videos by extracting frames and analyzing the frames as images.
- **DeepStack**: Uses the `DeepStack` AI server for detection. (In Progress)
  - Advanced
  - Higher acuuracy

## Features

1. **File Classification**: Identifies nudity in supported image and video files.
2. **File Management**: Copies files with detected nudity to an `exposed` folder for review.
3. **Report Generation**: Creates an Excel report in the `exposed` folder summarizing detection results.
4. **Multi-Threading**: Speeds up classification by processing files in parallel.
