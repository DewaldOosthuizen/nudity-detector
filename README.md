# Nudity Detector

This project, Nudity Detector, is a Python-based script designed to detect nudity in images and videos. It provides an
An efficient and automated solution for identifying explicit content, making it suitable for applications such as content
moderation, safety filters, and compliance checks.

## Overview

The **Nudity Detector** script is a tool for identifying nudity in images and videos. It uses AI-based models to classify files and organizes detected content into a dedicated folder, generating a comprehensive report afterward.

Two versions of the script are available:

- **Nudenet**: Uses the `nudenet` library for nudity detection.
  - Basic
  - Not always accurate
  - Process videos by extracting frames and analyzing the frames as images.
- **DeepStack**: Uses the `DeepStack` AI server for detection. (In Progress)

## Features

1. **Graphical User Interface**: Easy-to-use tkinter GUI with model selection and progress tracking.
2. **File Classification**: Identifies nudity in supported image and video files.
3. **File Management**: Copies files with detected nudity to an `exposed` folder for review.
4. **Report Generation**: Creates an Excel report in the `exposed` folder summarizing detection results.
5. **Multi-Threading**: Speeds up classification by processing files in parallel.
6. **Real-time Progress**: Visual progress indicators and logging during scanning.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DewaldOosthuizen/nudity-detector.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to inside the repository**:

   ```Bash
   cd nudity-detector
   ```

3. **Install requirements**:

  Activate the venv environment if you are using one.

  ```bash
  source ./.venv/bin/activate
  ```

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

  or

  ```bash
  ./.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

4. **Install docker and docker compose**

    - Follow the instructions for your OS on the official Docker website: <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>
    - Ensure Docker Compose is installed. Instructions can be found here: <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>
  
5. **Perpare Models**:

   - Nudenet
     - For Nudenet no setup is required.
   - Deepstack
     - Run the docker-compose.yml file to start your server

       ```bash
       docker-compose up --build
       ```

   - Once started, DeepStack will be available at <http://localhost:5000>.
   - You can test if your server is running by executing the following (Replace the image path with an existing image)

    ```bash
    curl -X POST -F image=@test.jpg 'http://localhost:5000/v1/vision/detection'
    ```

6. **Run the process**:

**Option 1: GUI Application (Recommended)**

  ```bash
  python3 nudity_detector_gui.py
  ```

  The GUI provides an easy-to-use interface with:
  - Model selection (NudeNet or DeepStack)
  - Folder browsing and selection
  - Progress tracking with visual indicators
  - Automatic report generation
  - Quick access to results and exposed files

**Option 2: Command Line**

- nudenet

  ```bash
  python3 nudity-detector-nudenet.py
  ```

- Deepstack

    ```bash
  python3 nudity-detector-deepstack.py
  ```

## Supported File Formats

### Images

- PNG
- JPG
- JPEG
- GIF
- BMP
- WEBP
- TIFF

### Videos

- MP4
- AVI
- MKV
- MOV
- VOB
- WMV

## Output

### Exposed Folder

Detected files are copied to an exposed folder created in the current directory.

### Report File

A detailed Excel report named nudity_report.xlsx is saved in the exposed folder.
The report includes:

- File path
- Nudity detection status
- Detected nudity classes

## Notes

DeepStack requires the AI server to be running during script execution.
Ensure sufficient disk space for processing large files or folders.
